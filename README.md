# PhysicsProject
Physics Projects about particle, Rigid body Dynamic, Collision detection and response. 

This is a visual studio project, previous implementation parts are commented. 

## Implementation: 
* Particle system: particle, particle structure, particle generator, lifetime, color, attractor, gravity features. 
* Rigid body Dynamics: Euler solver, Quaternions.
* Collision Dectection: AABB, GJK, Minkowski difference, Expending Polytope Algorithm (EPA).
